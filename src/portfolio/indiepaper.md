- **Modern Font Stacks**—system fonts that work across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android
- **Brutalist design**—greyscale aesthetic with focus on typography
- **Accessible by default**—semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, high contrast

Perfect for writers who want a no-fuss, fast, and independent blog that just works.
